# Aerospace Propulsion Case Study  
### Jet Engine Thrust & Performance Factors

---

## Overview
This case study examines the core variables that determine thrust in a basic turbojet engine. Instead of numerical simulation, the analysis focuses on the underlying physical and thermodynamic relationships that engineers use to evaluate engine performance.

The study aims to demonstrate foundational aerospace engineering understanding, particularly in propulsion systems.

---

## Introduction
Turbojet engines generate thrust by accelerating large amounts of air through a series of components:

1. **Inlet**
2. **Compressor**
3. **Combustor**
4. **Turbine**
5. **Exhaust nozzle**

The fundamental thrust equation is:

\[
F = \dot{m}(V_{exit} - V_{air})
\]

Where:

- \( F \) = thrust  
- \( \dot{m} \) = mass flow rate  
- \( V_{exit} \) = exit jet velocity  
- \( V_{air} \) = incoming air velocity  

Improving thrust means increasing mass flow rate, exit velocity, or both.

---

## Parameter Analysis

### **1. Compressor Pressure Ratio (CPR)**
The compressor’s job is to increase air pressure before combustion.  
A higher CPR leads to:

- Higher combustor temperatures  
- More energy added to the gas  
- Greater expansion through turbine and nozzle  
- Higher exhaust velocity  

**Outcome:**  
**Thrust increases as CPR increases**, with diminishing returns at very high ratios.

---

### **2. Ambient (Inlet) Temperature**
Ambient temperature affects **air density**.

- Hotter air = lower density  
- Lower density = reduced mass flow into the engine  

Because thrust depends on mass flow rate, hot conditions reduce thrust.

**Outcome:**  
**Thrust decreases** as inlet temperature increases.

This is why aircraft take longer to take off on hot days (“hot and high” conditions).

---

### **3. Mass Flow Rate**
Mass flow rate has a near-linear effect:

\[
F \propto \dot{m}
\]

Increasing \( \dot{m} \):

- Pushes more air through the core  
- Increases the total momentum change  
- Improves thrust in most regimes  

Large engines (like GE90 or Raptor) achieve massive thrust partially because of huge mass flow rates.

**Outcome:**  
Thrust increases proportionally with mass flow rate.

---

## Expected Performance Trends
If the results were plotted:

- **Pressure ratio vs. thrust:** Steep positive curve  
- **Inlet temperature vs. thrust:** Negative slope  
- **Mass flow rate vs. thrust:** Linear positive slope  

These trends match standard jet propulsion theory and industry performance charts.

---

## Engineering Significance
Understanding these relationships is essential for:

- Engine design  
- High-altitude performance prediction  
- Efficiency optimization  
- Managing thermal stresses  
- Aircraft mission planning  

Even without numerical simulation, this analysis demonstrates strong familiarity with propulsion fundamentals.

---

## Conclusion
This case study highlights how three core variables — **pressure ratio**, **inlet temperature**, and **mass flow rate** — directly impact turbojet thrust. These principles form the foundation of aerospace propulsion engineering and show how engine performance can be optimized for different flight conditions.
