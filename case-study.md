# Aerospace Propulsion Case Study  
### Jet Engine Thrust Analysis (Conceptual)

---

## Purpose
This case study explores how thrust in a basic turbojet engine is influenced by three key variables: compressor pressure ratio, inlet temperature, and mass flow rate. The goal is to demonstrate an understanding of core propulsion principles commonly covered in introductory aerospace engineering.

---

## Background
Jet engines generate thrust by accelerating air through the engine and out the exhaust nozzle. The fundamental thrust relationship is:

\[
F = \dot{m}(V_{exit} - V_{air})
\]

Increasing the energy of the airflow (through compression and combustion) raises the exhaust velocity, which directly increases thrust.

## Analysis Overview (Conceptual)
Although this case study does not use numerical simulations or programming, the physical relationships between variables and thrust output are well-established in propulsion theory.

### **1. Compressor Pressure Ratio**
- Higher pressure ratios increase the temperature and energy of the airflow entering the combustor.
- This results in stronger expansion in the turbine and nozzle.
- **Overall effect: Thrust increases as pressure ratio increases.**

### **2. Inlet Temperature**
- Higher ambient temperatures reduce air density.
- Lower air density reduces engine mass flow rate.
- **Overall effect: Thrust decreases as ambient temperature increases.**

### **3. Mass Flow Rate**
- Thrust is proportional to momentum change.
- Increasing mass flow rate increases the momentum of expelled air.
- **Overall effect: Thrust increases approximately linearly with mass flow rate.**

## Expected Trends
If the relationships were plotted, the trends would typically show:

- A **steep positive correlation** between pressure ratio and thrust.
- A **negative correlation** between inlet temperature and thrust.
- An **approximately linear upward trend** between mass flow rate and thrust.

These trends are consistent with standard propulsion models and experimental engine data.

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates an understanding of how key thermodynamic and aerodynamic variables influence jet engine thrust. Even without running simulations, analyzing these relationships provides meaningful insight into engine performance and highlights foundational concepts used throughout aerospace propulsion engineering.
