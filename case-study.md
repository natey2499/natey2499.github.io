# Aerospace Propulsion Case Study  
## Jet Engine Thrust Analysis

---

### 🔧 **Purpose**
To model simplified jet engine thrust using basic propulsion equations and analyze the influence of ambient temperature, pressure ratio, and mass flow rate.

---

### 🧠 **Background**
This project uses the simplified thrust equation:

\[
F = \dot{m}(V_\text{exit} - V_\text{air}) + (P_\text{exit} - P_\text{air})A
\]

We apply this to a turbofan-like setup using assumed compressor and turbine performance values.

### 📊 **Process**
1. Loaded atmospheric data  
2. Created functions for exit velocity  
3. Calculated net thrust  
4. Created plots of thrust vs pressure ratio  
5. Compared performance across conditions  

---

### 🛩️ **Key Insights**
- Higher pressure ratios dramatically increase thermal efficiency  
- Higher outside temperatures reduce thrust significantly  
- Cooler inlet temps = more mass flow = more thrust  
- Even simplified modeling shows real-world trends
