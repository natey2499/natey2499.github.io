# About Me

My name is **Nate Maranga**, and I am an aspiring aerospace engineer.  
I have a strong interest in propulsion systems, physics, and engineering design.

I am currently completing my A Levels in:

- **Maths**
- **Physics**
- **Business**

My long-term goal is to study **Aerospace Engineering** at a U.S. university and eventually serve in the Air Force. I enjoy hands-on learning, problem solving, and understanding the mechanics behind complex systems such as aircraft engines.

This portfolio highlights my early engineering work and the subjects I am passionate about as I continue to develop my skills.
